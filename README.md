## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The primary challenge was figuring out the button logic connection to the code. Everything in code is very particular in that there is a super specific way to create the desired outcome. In addition, finding where the functions/ buttons the instructions were referring to was one of the largest time consumers. Pictures would have been helpful but this also was a chance to mess with the Xcode playground.
